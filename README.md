Challenge - Two

Reverse a String

      There are multiple ways to reverse a string. The simplest, efficient way of accomplishing it without 
      encountering any performance overload is to iterate through the string in reverse direction and simulatneously 
      storing the character residing at that particular index value.

Checking whether a string is Palindrome or not!

      Palindrome can be defined as, a word when read from backward reads identical to when read from forward.
      few examples would be malayalam, madam, step on no pets and etcetera
      
      First of all, store the given string with it's case ignored, reverse it and compare this reversed string with
      the original one using .equals method of String class as it compares the content present within the string objects
      instead objects memory location.

Coming to the second part of the challenge - Two
      
      It's all about creating a couple of Entity/BEAN/POJO classes, where first one holds every single entity's basic information with no  
      address information and this address information is stored in another Entity/BEAN class which will be in " HAS-A " relatioship
      with the earlier class. 
      
      As we are creating our own custom object, it's our obligatory duty to override the implmentation for the toString method of
      java.lang.object withrespect to our BEAN/POJO class.
